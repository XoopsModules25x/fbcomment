<h3>Quick Start Guide to FBComment</h3>

<h4 class="odd">Overview</h4>

<p class="even"><b>FBComment</b> provides blocks which add Facebook&reg; Like Button and Comments functionality to your site. Page specific comments 
can be added quickly without requiring any changes to module templates. Open Graph meta tags are automatically added to pages where 
the blocks are used, and additional page specific data can be easily specified using the built in Open Graph Meta Data editor.

<h4 class="odd">First Steps</h4>

<p class="even">Although not strictly necessary, you may want to register <i>yourself as a developer</i> (and <i>optionally, your site as an application</i>) on <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/</a>.

<p class="even">Familiarize yourself with the Facebook Social Plugins you are going to use. These resources may be helpful:

<ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
<li><a href=http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/"  target="_blank">Like Button</a>
<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/"  target="_blank">Comments</a>
<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraphprotocol/"  target="_blank">Open Graph Protocol</a>
</ul>

<h4 class="odd">Configuration</h4>
Enter <b>either</b> (not both) your numeric facebook user id (<a href="http://findmyfacebookid.com/" target="_blank">Here 
is a tool to help find that.</a>) as an admin or your assigned application id in the module preferences. If you don't, things 
will still function, but the Facebook debugger will complain, and you will not be able to moderate comments left on your pages. 
You can specify multiple admins by entering multiple numeric facebook user ids separated by commas, but be aware that this will 
only work correctly if you enable the smarty open graph meta data option as described next.

<p class="even">For the best results, add the following Smarty tag to the <i>&lt;head&gt;</i> section of your theme's theme.html:
<pre style="font-family: courier,mono;">
      &lt;{$fbcomment_og_metas}&gt;
</pre>

<p class="even">Then choose 'Yes' for the Enable Smarty Open Graph Meta data option in FBComment module preferences. This will give 
you the best meta tags possible for communicating with Facebook. (Note: The theme change is <b>required</b> if you choose 'Yes' 
for this option.) With this option set to 'No' Facebook will still find most of the information it wants, but it will issue 
warnings when checking your pages, and some administrative tools will not be available.

<p class="even">You might also want to specify a default <em>og:image</em> to be used if no image is supplied by the Open Graph Editor or 
through a plugin. This image should be specified as a fully qualified URL, and should be at least 200x200 pixels. Keep in mind
that Facebook will resize this image to fit its layout, so a little extra size makes for a better presentation. 
If no image is specifed, Facebook will attempt to grab an image from your page and use that. While it makes a decent attempt, the 
results can be disappointing. Supplying a default here gives you control over how your pages will be presented.

<p class="even">Enable the blocks of your choice on your site to suit your needs.

<p class="even">Check your site with the Facebook Debugger at <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug" 
target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug</a> to check for problems.

<h4 class="odd">Block Options</h4>

<p class="even">Most of the options are explained in the Facebook social plugin documentation mentioned above, and control how the plugin is 
displayed on your site.

<p class="even">The option requiring the most attention is the "Source of URL sent to Facebook." Each page where a block is displayed needs to supply 
a URL (the <em>og:url</em> property) to Facebook to identify what is being 'Liked' or 'Commented'. You can specify a specific URL (so, 
for example, a like button will like the whole site) or use the Automatic URL and Variables options to build canonical URLs for the pages 
(so that each page gets its own comments, for example.)

<p class="even">Consider a news module that can highlight the key words used in a search. A visitor might search the site, and end up viewing 
an article with a URL like "http://example.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=256&keywords=skateboard". Now imagine the visitor
adds a comment. If the comment referenced the whole URL, nobody would find the comment on your site without searching for "skateboard"
and this is probably not what you want. Maybe even worse, the visitor could be oblivious to all of the comments left by other visitors,
since they didn't all search for "skateboard either.

<p class="even">To solve this problem we need to eliminate the junk from the URL we use to hang our comments on, or in a more concise wording, make 
it a canonical URL. FBComment implements this filtering with a whitelist of variables to include. By adding "storyid" into this list 
(and making sure "keywords" is not in the list) the above referenced URL would become 
"http://example.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=256". Now, no matter what else is going on, all comments for the story will be 
grouped together, and everyone visiting the page will see them no matter how they got there. Also, if your site can be accessed by both 
http and https protocols you may also want to use the <em>Automatic Force to http://</em> option so that all comments will be under 
a single URL (so "https://example.com/" becomes "http://example.com/".)

<p class="even">You can also require that something from the variable whitelist be found in the URL before the comments are enabled. This feature can
be used to allow comments on articles while keepings them off of the index page and other such places where they might not be appropriate.


<h4 class="odd">Open Graph Protocol Meta Data Editor</h4>
<p class="even">If you have admin rights to the FBComment module, and FBComment blocks will display an clickable icon to bring up the meta data
editor for the <em>og:url</em> that is presented by the page. In this editor you can upload an image to be associated with your page, and supply a title and 
description, giving you a chance to supply a customized view of your individual page when it is shared on Facebook.

<h4 class="odd">Important Note</h4>
<p class="even">If you use more than one block on a page, keep in mind that there can only be ONE set of Open Graph data associated 
with a given page. If the blocks specify different URLs, only one of them will be used.

<h4 class="odd">Module Permissions</h4>
<p class="even">This module does not have a real main page at this time. It consists only of blocks and the necessary scripts to support 
those blocks. Attempts to use the fbcomment/index.php will result in a fully functional empty page. It is recommended to turn it off
in the main menu in the CMS module administration area.

<p class="even">Group access permissions to the FBComment module are required to use the blocks, above and beyond the block display permission. 
Interacting with the blocks records the URL, action and datetime, and also triggers XOOPS style notification via AJAX style calls to scripts in 
the fbcomment directory which use the standard mainfile inclusion which adds a layer of additional protections (such as protector) but requires access permissions to work as intended. 

<p class="even">Also note, in normal operation, Facebook will pull data from your site as the <b>anonymous</b> user. 
If blocks are not visible, the meta data Facebook expects will not be exposed, and the results will be less than optimal.

<p class="even">Module administration permissions enable in-block editing of Open Graph meta data.

<h4 class="odd">Plugins</h4>
<p class="even">It is possible to extend the default Open Graph data for a module through the use of plugins. Plugins can supply 
page appropriate images, titles, better descriptions, canonical URLs, and more. The plugin mechanism is documented in the docs 
folder of the FBComment module distribution.

<h4 class="odd">Notifications and Logging</h4>
<p class="even">As mentioned under permissions, each like and comment action is captured. Module administrators may subscribe
standard XOOPS style notifications of new actions. A summary of the most recent activity is available in the module administration 
area. Likes and comments are recorded in separate tables. The captured data is in aggregate, and no identifying user data is 
recorded by this module (but what Facebook does with the data is anyone's guess.) The data consists of the URL, the first time the 
action occurred for URL, the most recent time the action for the URL occurred, and the total number of times the action has occurred. 
This data is captured, but beyond the simple recent displays, it is not otherwise processed in the module at this time. (But it would
be a great use for gwreports to study it the way you want to see it.)
